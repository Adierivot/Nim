This is the README file that will be used for this project.
This the ever classic game of Nim written in the JAVA programming language 

Before you play
==============================================
Simply unpack all files into a folder of your choosing. Then compile and run the tester.java 
(This game runs in the terminal)

Enjoy beating all your friends or challenge the Watson-like skills of Smart computer.

Instructions on how to play the game
===============================================
1) Select Player 1 Type. Then Insert Player Name 
2) Repeat Step 1 for Player 2.
3) Player 1 and 2 make their moves until the end of the game


NOTE: The game is written in a way that if you start it, I will assume you want to at least play one game as the option to play another game or quit given at the end of each game (Why would you not want to play another game anyway?) 

Dev Notes
================================================
[10.24.2012] Moving lighting fast through this stuff. Thinking of adding a log that records the date and time of the game session and tallies the wins or something. Also planning on moving the entire program to run in a Java swing panel.
